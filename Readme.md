## Introduction
In this project, we leverage the power of Grounding Dino, Segment Anything Model, and Stable Diffusion to perform high-level object detection, object segmentation, and inpainting. These techniques combine state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms to achieve accurate and robust results.

## Installation
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/chemicoholic21/Image-processing-website.git`
2. Run the cells in google colab or jupyter notebook.

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and ensure it is properly formatted.
2. Run the `main.py` script to start the high-level object detection and object segmentation process.
3. Use the generated results for further analysis or inpainting tasks.

## Contributing
