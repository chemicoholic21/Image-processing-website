## Introduction
In this project, we leverage the power of Grounding Dino, Segment Anything Model, and Stable Diffusion to perform high-level object detection, object segmentation, and inpainting. These techniques combine state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms to achieve accurate and robust results.

## Installation
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/chemicoholic21/Image-processing-website.git`
2. Run the cells in google colab or jupyter notebook.

## Usage
-Navigate to the file Image-processing.ipynb in the repository's file list.
-Click on the file to open it in the GitHub file viewer.
-In the top-right corner of the file viewer, you will see a button that says "Open in Colab" (assuming the file is compatible with Google Colab). Click on this button.
-This will open the notebook in Google Colab, where you can run the code cells and interact with the notebook.
-If you don't have a Google account or prefer to run the notebook locally, you can click on the "Raw" button in the GitHub file viewer to view the raw contents of the notebook.
-Copy the raw contents of the notebook and save it as a .ipynb file on your local machine.
-Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab on your local machine.
-Navigate to the directory where you saved the .ipynb file.
-Open the file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
-Now you can run the code cells in the notebook by clicking on them and either pressing Shift + Enter or clicking the "Run" button in the toolbar.
